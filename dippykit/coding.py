    """Encodes an integer vector using huffman encoding
    
    Given a vector (one-dimensional ndarray) with either signed or unsigned 
    integer dtype, this function huffman encodes it. The process for this is 
    the following:
    
    #. If no symbol-code dictionary is provided, create one. The symbol 
       code dictionary (symbol_code_dict) correlates the values in the input 
       vector to the variable-bit-length values in the output vector. In the 
       case that no symbol-code dictionary was provided, a symbol-probability 
       dictionary (symbol_probability_dict) is generated. This symbol 
       probability dictionary has a key set of all unique symbols in im_vec 
       and a value set containing each unique symbol's frequency in im_vec. 
       The symbol-code dictionary is then generated using 
       :func:`huffman_dict` with the symbol-probability dictionary as its 
       argument. This symbol-code dictionary now contains the statistically 
       optimal compressive encoding scheme.
        
    #. Translate the im_vec vector into its huffman encoded version by 
       replacing each integer value with its appropriate bit sequence in the 
       the symbol-code dictionary. 
    
    #. Pack the bit sequence into a byte sequence (represented as a 
       one-dimensional ndarray of dtype ``uint8``). The last byte is 
       right-padded with 0s if the number of bits in the bit sequence was not 
       a perfect multiple of 8. 
    
    #. Return the following data (in order) as a tuple:
    
        * byte sequence
        * the number of bits in the previous step's bit stream
        * the symbol-code dictionary (symbol_code_dict)
        * the symbol-probability dictionary (symbol_probability_dict)
        
    To reverse the huffman encoding, you can pass the first, third, 
    and second returned values to the :func:`huffman_decode` function in 
    that order. Optionally, (for optimal speed) pass the length of the 
    original image vector (im_vec) to :func:`huffman_decode` as the 
    init_arr_size keyword argument.
    
    :type im_vec: ``numpy.ndarray``
    :param im_vec: A vector with either signed integer or unsigned integer 
        dtype to be huffman encoded. With images, one can trivially make them 
        vectors by using the numpy method **im.reshape(-1)**.

          binary codes

    Given a huffman encoded byte stream and a symbol-code dictionary,

    The huffman encoded byte stream (im_encoded) must be represented as a 
    one-dimensional ndarray with dtype ``uint8``. The symbol-code dictionary 
    must be represented as a dictionary that maps either signed integer or 
    unsigned integer symbols to ndarrays with boolean dtype (these ndarrays 
    are the binary huffman codes that compose im_encoded). 
    
    The stream_length argument (optional) is an integer that represents the 
    number of bits in im_encoded that actually represent the image vector. 
    Often times, huffman encoding a vector yields a bit stream whose length 
    is not a perfect multiple of 8, therefore the byte stream will be padded 
    at the end with 0s. Specifying stream_length prevents against extra 
    additional values that may arise from these padded 0s.
